Directory/Folder Structure:
- Create a single master directory (folder) on your hard drive to contain all clinical pearls and pictures.

- Example: A directory called [Helgas Pearls] is located at [c:\Users\Documents\Helgaa Pearls]. Inisde [c:\Users\Documents\Helgaa Pearls] there is a folder [Bacterial Conjunctivitis] which path looks like [c:\Users\Documents\Helgaa Pearls\Bacterial Conjunctivitis]. There is another folder [Retinal Detachment] which path looks like this [c:\Users\Documents\Helgaa Pearls\Retinal Detachment]

Patient Mode vs Doctor Mode:
- This allows you to have information and pictures visible on your screen pertinent to explaining in laman's terms to your patient.
